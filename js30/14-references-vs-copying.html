    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // const editedPlayers = Array.from(players);

    // const editedPlayers = players.slice();

    // const editedPlayers = players.concat();

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const editedPlayers = [...players];

    editedPlayers.push('Poppy Gloria');
    console.dir(editedPlayers);
    console.dir(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const copiedPerson = { ...person };
    copiedPerson.number = 1535435;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // const copiedPerson = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });

  //  const copiedPerson = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));

    console.dir(person);
    console.dir(copiedPerson);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
